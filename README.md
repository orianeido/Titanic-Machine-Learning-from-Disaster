## TL;DR
This is a clasification problem when we want to know if passenger has survived the titanic or not.

First of all I did EDA on the data to understand what are the features and filling missing values, next I presented some of the data with Bar Chart, Pairplot and Heatmap.

The next step was performing features engineering: converting categorical to numerical, extract the title from name, using only the letter in cabin and remove unnesscery features.

Then I split the data to 80% train and 20% test and used 3 Classification: Logistic Regression, Sklearn SGDClassifier and MLP.

The results I got was that Sklearn SGDClassifier was the most accurate
